Assumptions:
* Exactly one section SHT_SYMTAB exists and it links to .strtab
* There can be dead strings in some SHT_STRTAB
  https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54813/chapter6-73709.html#scrolltoc
  This documentation suggests that unreferenced strings are allowed, so I'm
  keeping names of removed sections for simplicity.
* .syntab does not exits, and .strtab and .shstrtab can be glued together into
  .strtab if both exist (gcc produces both, clang only the former, so I'll act
  like clang)
* All sections get aligned to 16 for simplicity. It is assumed that header size
  is divisible by 16.
